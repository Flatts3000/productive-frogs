/**
 * Mod configuration spec. Single COMMON config holding everything the
 * mod exposes to operators — Slime Milk source-block tuning (J4/J5
 * production keystone) and the Resource Slime random-discovery chance
 * (promoted out of the public-static testing hack in
 * {@code SlimeSplitDiscoveryHandler}).
 *
 * <p>Registered against {@code ModConfig.Type.COMMON} from the mod
 * constructor; that type runs on both client and dedicated server and
 * syncs nothing (each side keeps its own copy). For values that need
 * to be authoritative on the server only, {@code SERVER} would be more
 * correct — none of these qualify in V1 because the milker block runs
 * its tick loop server-side and the only client read would be a
 * cosmetic depletion shader (deferred polish).
